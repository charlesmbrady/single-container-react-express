to run this project, clone the repo

then cd into the /client directory

from there, you can do 'yarn install' to install dependencies and then 'yarn build' and then 'yarn start-server'

OR 
if you have docker and docker-compose (get them here https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), you can skip that step and just do 'yarn build', then 'docker-compose build' and when that is finished run 'docker-compose up' then it should be running on localhost:4000
